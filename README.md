# Leal's Family Christmas List Directory 2023

## Description

A personal site that documents my loved ones christmas list that is dedicated for the family to help know what to get for secret santa.

I pushed myself to navigate this starter code provided by Jack Herrington (Link is noted), to familiarize myself with NextJs and to utilize graphql.

## Business Case

We do this every year and I wanted to have a place where I can store all of the Christmas list for every family member so that we don't have to scroll up on our family chat.

I hope to add a database to this project but in the meanwhile Im sticking to hardcoding the data to learn nextjs.
